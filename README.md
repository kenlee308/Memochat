# Memochat & Memochat Plus
**Origin:** Original Work  
**Type:** Full-Stack Web Application (React + Python/FastAPI)  

**Description:**  
Memochat is a privacy-focused, locally-hosted AI assistant emphasizing long-term memory and persistent identity, using a hybrid stack for deep recall and consistency. As a founder-engineer with a background in applied physics and industrial product management, Kenny Lee created this to bridge real-world expertise (e.g., optimizing electromechanical systems) with AI agents that "remember" users over time—promoting AI literacy through hands-on interaction and ethical data handling. It aligns with the DOL's AI Literacy Framework by enabling workers in sectors like robotics and automation to experiment with AI memory systems, building foundational skills in a safe, local environment.

**Key Features:**  
- **Hybrid Memory:** Combines vector search (FAISS) with structured categorization for accurate, context-aware recall.  
- **Consistency Audit:** "Neural Core Resolution" detects and resolves memory conflicts, teaching users about AI reliability.  
- **Local Privacy:** All processing via Ollama ensures data stays offline, ideal for workforce training without cloud risks.  
- **Visual Memory Panel:** Real-time insights into AI "memories," enhancing educational transparency.

**How to Use:**  
1. Start System: Run `start_all.bat` to launch backend (FastAPI) and frontend (Vite).  
2. Access UI: Interact via browser or console.  
3. Chat: Engage the bot; it auto-saves details for persistent learning.  
4. Manage Memory: Edit/delete via side panel.  
5. Diagnostics: Run `run_system_check.bat` for troubleshooting.  

**Note:** Includes `memochat` (v3) and `memochat_plus` (v3.1 with advanced audits)—use respective startup scripts.  

**Alignment Note:** Tailored for grants focused on AI workforce development, this app demonstrates tools for teaching AI persistence and ethics, encouraging collaboration in upskilling programs.
